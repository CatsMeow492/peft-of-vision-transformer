# Adaptive LoRA and QA-LoRA Analysis Summary

**Analysis Date:** 2025-07-25T13:07:43.205593

## Key Findings

Layer Importance Patterns:
  • High variability in layer importance suggests strong differentiation between layers
  • Adaptive rank allocation shows significant differentiation between layers
  • Layer 'attention.query' shows 2.3x higher importance than 'mlp.fc2'
QA-LoRA Effectiveness:
  • Best QA-LoRA configuration: 8bit_linear with 0.8167 accuracy
  • 8-bit quantization shows 1.0% better accuracy than 4-bit
Adaptive vs Fixed Comparison:
  • Adaptive and fixed methods show similar accuracy performance
  • Fixed methods use 56.7% fewer parameters
  • Adaptive methods are 100.0% faster to train
