# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This research project aims to produce a publishable paper on Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Vision Transformers using LoRA and quantization techniques. The study will be conducted on resource-constrained hardware (M2 MacBook with 96GB memory) to demonstrate practical applicability. The research will extend successful NLP PEFT techniques to the vision domain, providing novel empirical insights and establishing benchmarks for efficient ViT adaptation. The goal is to contribute original research suitable for publication in a top-tier ML conference or journal.
